VS2019 Community Edition Project
================================
Requires 64-bit Windows and OpenGL v3.3+ compatibility

Projects should be setup to run within the IDE already, however in case there's an
error here's a quick checklist:
	- Config is x64
	- Go into Project Preferences -> VC++ Directories and check/add:
		- '$(SolutionDir)\GL Dependencies\lib;' folder in Library Directories
		- '$(SolutionDir)\GL Dependencies\include;' folder in Include Directories
	- Go into Project Preferences -> Linker -> Input and check/add:
		- "glfw3.lib;" in Additional Dependencies (this should be present in 
			'GL Dependencies\lib' folder)
		- "opengl32.lib;" in Additional Dependencies (this lib comes with the 
			Microsoft SDK and does not need to be downloaded)
	- Add 'GL Dependencies\glad.c' to project source files (right click 'Source Files'
		in solution explorer -> Add Existing)

To Execute:
	1. Either:
	- Run in VS IDE with Release | x64 configuration (Debug works as well but will be 
		slower)
	- Launch desired program executable: Q1.exe or Q2.exe

	2. Follow command line instructions and prompts

Note: In case of VS compilation error, try splitting the two projects into different
	solutions stored in different directories
	
	**Note: Most events are programmed to wait for the user to press [SPACE]
		before continuing.
	**Note: Press [ENTER] and leave input blank to select default option for
		command line prompts that specify a default.
	**Note: For Q2, the program will prompt the user to enter a filename. If the
		entered filename corresponds to a file in Cluster Compressed Image
		format (with extension .cci), the program will open the image in a 
		viewer. Otherwise, the program will attempt to open the file as an
		image in a standard format that the user wishes to compress.
